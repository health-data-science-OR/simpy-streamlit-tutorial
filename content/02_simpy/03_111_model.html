<h2>3. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">simpy</span></code> resources<a class="headerlink" href="#simpy-resources" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>To model the call centre we need to introduce a <strong>resource</strong>.  If a resource is not available then a process will pause.  We create a resource as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">operators</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">simpy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Resource</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">env</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">capacity</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When we want to request a resource in our process we create a with block as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">operators</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">request</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">req</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="n">req</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This tells simpy that your process needs an operator resource to progress.  The code will pause until a resource is yielded. This gives us our queuing effect.  If a resource is not available immediately then the process will wait until one becomes available.  We will practice this a lot in the course so do not worry if this does not make sense immediately.</p>

<h2>4. The service function.<a class="headerlink" href="#the-service-function" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>We will first build the service function. We need to do this because our arrival/generator function will be required to call it.</p>
<p>We need to include the following logic:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Request and if necessary wait for a call operator</p></li>
<li><p>Undergo phone triage (a delay). This is a sample from the Triangular distribution.</p></li>
<li><p>Exit the system.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We will build this as a simple python function that we will call <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">service</span></code>.  Each patient caller that arrives to the simulation will execute service as a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">simpy</span></code> process.  We will pass a unique patient identifier, a pool of operator resources and the environment to the function.</p>
