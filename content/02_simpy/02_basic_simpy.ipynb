    "An advantage of `simpy` over commercial simulation packages is its simplicity and flexibility.  As it is part of python, it is often straightforward to use `simpy` to model complex logic and make use of the SciPy stack!  Initially, you will need to write a lot of code. But don't worry. As you use `simpy` you will build your own library of reusable code that you can draw on (and build on) for future simulation projects.  As `simpy` is free and open it has a big advantage over commercial software for both research: it is more transparent, can be readily shared with others, and can easily link to other data science tools such as those from machine learning.    \n",

    "\n",
    "In this first example, let's assume (unrealistically) that prescriptions arrive **exactly** 5 minutes apart.  To build this model we need the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **A simpy environment**\n",
    "\n",
    "`simpy` has process based worldview.  These processes take place in an environment.  You can create a environment with the following line of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "env = simpy.Environment()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **simpy timeouts**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can introduce **delays** or **activities** into a process.  For example these might be the duration of a stay on a ward, or the duration of a operation.  In this case we are going to introduce a delay between arrivals (inter-arrival time).  In `simpy` you control this with the following method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "activity_duration = 20\n",
    "env.timeout(activity_duration)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **generators**\n",
    "\n",
    "The event process mechanism in `simpy` is implemented using python generators.  A basic generator function that yields a new arrival every 5 minutes looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def prescription_arrival_generator(env):\n",
    "    while True:\n",
    "        yield env.timeout(5.0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the generator takes the environment as a parameter.  It then internally calls the `env.timeout()` method in an infinite loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **running a `simpy` model**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have coded the model logic and created an environment instance, there are two remaining instructions we need to code.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. set the generator up as a simpy process\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "env.process(prescription_arrival_generator(env))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. run the environment for a user specified run length\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "env.run(until=25)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The run method handle the infinite loop we set up in `prescription_arrival_generator`. The simulation model has an internal concept of time.  It will end execution when its internal clock reaches 25 time units.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Now that we have covered the basic building blocks, let's code the actual model.**  It makes sense to create our model logic first.  The code below will generate arrivals every 5 minutes.  Note that the function takes an environment object as a parameter."
