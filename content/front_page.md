# Preface

Welcome to a short method tutorial for building free and open source computer simulation models in python using `simpy` and `streamlit`.

```{admonition} Free and open source software (FOSS)
:class: warning
Most people are familiar with "open source" software.  The "free" in FOSS is less well understood.  It standands for "freedom" as opposed to price.  In general, the license associated with FOSS provides users the freedom to use, adapt and distribute copies of their own software to benefit others.  All the software used in this tutorial is FOSS.
```

## Where to start

* Please follow the [instructions to install python](./01_setup/install) and setup the `conda` virtual environment on your own machine. 
* Checkout the [background reading](./01_setup/reading)
* [Citing the materials](./01_setup/citation)
