    "# Collecting results from a single run\n",
    "\n",
    "A tool like `simpy` allows you to collect your data flexibly using an approach that makes sense to you! Some options are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code an auditor / observer process**.  This process will periodically observe the state of the system. We can use this to collect information on **current state at time t**. For example, how many patients are queuing and how many have a call in progress between by time of day.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Store process metrics during a run and perform calculations at the end of a run**. For example, if you want to calculate mean patient waiting time then store each patient waiting time in a list and calculate the mean at the end of the run.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Conduct and audit or calculate running statistics as the simulation executes an event**.  For example, as a patient completes a call we can calculate a running mean of waiting times and a running total of the operators are taking calls. The latter measure can then be used to calculate server utilisation. You could also use this approach to audit queue length where the queue length is recorded each time request for a resource is made (and/or when a resource is released).\n"

    "## 2. Calculating mean waiting time\n",
    "\n",
    "The second strategy to results collection is to store either a reference to a quantitative value (e.g. waiting time) during the run.  Once the run is complete you will need to include a procedure for computing the metric of interest.  **An advantage** of this strategy is that it is very simple, captures all data, and has minimal computational overhead during a model run!  **A potential disadvantage** is that for complex simulation you may end up storing a large amount of data in memory. In these circumstances, it may be worth exploring event driven strategies to reduce memory requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we will store each patient's waiting time in a python list. At the end of the run we will loop through these references and calculate **mean waiting time** and **operator utilisation**. \n",
