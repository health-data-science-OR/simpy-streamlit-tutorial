    "## 1. Adding a first slider\n",
    "\n",
    "A slider provides a simple way to vary an input. We specify a minimum and maximum value inputs can accept, the default value, and a step.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "slider_name = st.slider(slider_name, min_value, max_value, default_value, step)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new file called `interactive_app.py` and copy paste in the code from `basic_app.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "To create one to represent the number of operators we can include the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "n_operators = st.slider('Call operators', 1, 20, 13, step=1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This displays a slider on the page with a label \"Call operators\".  Its minimum value is 1.0, its maximum value is 20.0. its default value is 13.0 and it increments (slides) by 1.  The variable `n_operators` is an int.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. How `streamlit` works\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time a user updates the value of a slider or clicks the run button `streamlit` executes the full `interactive_app.py` script i.e. from top to bottom. This means that the int value of `n_operators` changes each time the slider is moved. This also explains how the `st.button` function works. When clicked it is assigned the value `True`.  Streamlit then executes the full script and will also execute the conditional logic contained under the if statement.  When a slider is change the button has a value of `False` so the model will not run unnecessarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Add remaining sliders\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do the same for nurses, chance of callback and number of replications\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "n_operators = st.slider('Call operators', 1, 20, 13, step=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "n_nurses = st.slider('Nurses', 1, 15, 9, step=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "chance_callback = st.slider('Chance of nurse callback', 0.1, 1.0, 0.4,\n",
    "                            step=0.05, help='Set the chance of a call back')\n",
    "\n",
    "n_reps = st.slider(\"No. of replications\", 5, 100, step=1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Run the app\n",
    "\n",
    "As before run the app using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "streamlit run interactive_app.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The full code listing and a screen shot of the app is below."
